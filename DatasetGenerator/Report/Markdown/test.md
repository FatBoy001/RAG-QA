**Non-GAAP Measures**

**To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company**
**uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP**
**gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other**
**income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For**
**NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a**
**reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures**
**to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related**
**costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and**
**the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by**
**operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on**
**property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures**
**enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the**
**company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s**
**financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-**
**GAAP measures used by other companies.**
