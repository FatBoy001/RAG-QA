These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP**\n**gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other**\n**income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For**\n**NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a**\n**reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures**\n**to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related**\n**costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related**\n**to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated**\n**as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and**\n**principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP**\n**financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The**\n**presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for**\n**the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be**\n**different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.**\n\n**NVIDIA CORPORATION**\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME**\n\n**(In millions, except per share data)**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**NVIDIA CORPORATION**\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**\n\n**(In millions)**\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**NVIDIA CORPORATION**\n\n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS**\n\n**(In millions)**\n**(Un"
