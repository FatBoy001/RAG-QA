The webcast will be**\n**recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA\u2019s conference call to discuss its financial results for its first quarter of fiscal**\n\n**2024.**\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\n**To supplement NVIDIA\u2019s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company**\n**uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP**\n**gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other**\n**income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For**\n**NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a**\n**reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures**\n**to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs,**\n**contributions, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, restructuring costs and other, gains and losses from non-affiliated**\n\n**investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, the associated tax impact of these items where**\n**applicable, foreign tax benefit and domestication tax adjustments. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided**\n**by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on**\n**property and equipment and intangible assets.
