A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the**\n**conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA\u2019s investor relations website,** **https://investor.nvidia.com** **.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP**\n**gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other**\n**income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For**\n**NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a**\n**reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures**\n**to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related**\n**costs, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to"
" from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and**\n**the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by**\n**operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property**\n**and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the**\n**user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-**\n**GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results**\n**prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company\u2019s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures**\n**used by other companies.**\n\n**Weighted average shares used in**\n\n**NVIDIA CORPORATION**\n\n**RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP OUTLOOK**\n\n**About NVIDIA**\n\n**Since its founding in 1993,** **NVIDIA** **(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. The company\u2019s**\n**invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of**\n**modern AI and is fueling industrial digitalization across markets.
